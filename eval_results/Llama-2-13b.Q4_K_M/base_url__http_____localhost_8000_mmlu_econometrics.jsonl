Which of the following statements are true?\nA. The test statistic will follow a chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom under the null hypothesis\nB. The value of the log-likelihood function will almost always be bigger for the restricted model than for the unrestricted model\nC. If the relevant values of the log-likelihood functions are -112.3 and -118.4, the value of the test statistic is 12.2\nD. The likelihood ratio test compares the slopes of the log-likelihood function at the maximum and at the restricted parameter value.\nAnswer:",
