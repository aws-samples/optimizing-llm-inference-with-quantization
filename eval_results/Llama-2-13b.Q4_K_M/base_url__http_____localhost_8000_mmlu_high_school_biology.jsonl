Which of the following statement best explains how the resistant mosquitoes arose?\nA. Some mosquitoes experienced a mutation after being exposed to DDT that made them resistant to the insecticide. Then their population expanded because these moquitoes had no competition.\nB. Some mosquitoes were already resistant to DDT when DDT was first sprayed. Then their population expanded because all the susceptible mosquitoes had been exterminated.\nC. DDT is generally a very effective insecticide. One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly.\nD. Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.\nAnswer:",

Furthermore, pathogens that need to escape the immune system rely on this variation to generate new surface antigens that go unrecognized by the host\u2019s immune system. Which of the following is an example of this antigenic variation?\nA. HIV, which can remain integrated into the host genome for many years\nB. The flu virus, which changes its envelope proteins\nC. MRSA, which has become resistant to many antibiotics\nD. Multiple sclerosis, which attacks the cells of the nervous system\nAnswer:",

Adaptations beneficial in one habitat should generally be beneficial in all other habitats as well.\nB. Different species that occupy the same habitat will adapt to that habitat by undergoing the same genetic changes.\nC. Adaptations beneficial at one time should generally be beneficial during all other times as well.\nD.
